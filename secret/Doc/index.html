                <p>The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the
                    value. Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most
                    other
                    languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example:</p>

                <p>The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6)
                    have
                    type float. We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial.</p>

                <p>Division (/) always returns a float. To do floor division and get an integer result (discarding any
                    fractional result) you can use the // operator; to calculate the remainder you can use %:</p>

                <code>17 / 3 # classic division returns a float</code>

                <ul>
                    <li>With Python, it is possible to use the ** operator to calculate powers 1:</li>

                    <li>If a variable is not “defined” (assigned a value), trying to use it will give you an error:</li>

            <article>
                <p>Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can
                    be
                    enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result 2. \ can be used to
                    escape quotes:</p>

                <p>In the interactive interpreter, the output string is enclosed in quotes and special characters are
                    escaped with backslashes. While this might sometimes look different from the input (the enclosing
                    quotes
                    could change), the two strings are equivalent. The string is enclosed in double quotes if the string
                    contains a single quote and no double quotes, otherwise it is enclosed in single quotes. The print()
                    function produces a more readable output, by omitting the enclosing quotes and by printing escaped
                    and
                    special characters:</p>

                <code> print('C:\some\name') # here \n means newline!</code>

            <article>
                <p>Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile
                    is
                    the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets.
                    Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.</p>

                <code>squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]</code>

                <p>Like strings (and all other built-in sequence types), lists can be indexed and sliced:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Lists also support operations like concatenation</li>
                    <li>Unlike strings, which are immutable, lists are a mutable type, i.e. it is possible to change
                        their
                        content</li>
                    <li>The built-in function len() also applies to lists</li>
                </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Sets">
            <header>Sets</header>
            <article>
                <p>Python also includes a data type for sets. A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate
                    elements.
                    Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support
                    mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.</p>
                <p>Curly braces or the set() function can be used to create sets. Note: to create an empty set you have
                    to
                    use set(), not {}; the latter creates an empty dictionary, a data structure that we discuss in the
                    next
                    section.</p>
                <code>basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}</code>

            <article>
                <p>Another useful data type built into Python is the dictionary (see Mapping Types — dict). Dictionaries
                    are
                    sometimes found in other languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike
                    sequences,
                    which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any
                    immutable
                    type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only
                    strings,
                    numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot
                    be
                    used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index
                    assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and extend().</p>
                <p>It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys
                    are
                    unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a
                    comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the
                    dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.</p>
